# Budgetfy

Budgetfy is a web app that enables users to keep track of their expenses.
It allows users to add/edit and categorize their expenses, and also 
create custom categories and assign to each expense.

We intend in the future to implement expenses report, and budget control tools 
to help users to save money.

The user can login using a registered account or a facebook account.

## How to Run

You can run the project executing the following command in the terminal:

```terminal
$> python webserver.wsgi
```

You can then access the web app in the address; **http://localhost:5000/**

## Development database

The source file *dev_db.py* bootstraps a development database with some few
pre-defined entries.

## Dependencies

The dependencies are described in the file requirements.txt generated by pip freeze 
and can be installed executing the following command:

```terminal
$> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The file might contain dependencies included with 
the vagrant provided by Udacity.
